- Middleware setup for logging, parsing JSON, and handling CORS
- Error handling
- Static file serving
- Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

1. You have installed Node.js (which includes npm).
2. You have a basic understanding of JavaScript and Node.js.

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
3. Create a .env file in the root directory of your project and add the following environment variables:
